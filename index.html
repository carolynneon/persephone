    <p>I’ve never had a personal log before.  Like, I’ve heard all that stuff about
    how journaling is supposed to be good for you psychologically and whatever, but
    every time I’ve tried to get into it I kept it up for like a week at most.
    Sectan requires us to keep one, though, probably for some baseline morale
    metric, so maybe this time will be different?</p>
    <p>I’m glad it’s encrypted—all they can see is that I’m <em>making</em> entries, and
    roughly how long they are, not what they say. Means I can say whatever shit I
    want and nobody’s the wiser.</p>
