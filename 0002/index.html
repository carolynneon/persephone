    <h1>PSL 003-1452</h1>

    <p>Today, three separate lighting control boards gave up the magic blue smoke. That’s the 3rd month in a row that’s happened… on the 3rd of the month. I wouldn’t put it past Devin to break stuff and give me more work to do, but I don’t think he could stomach that much fun and coordination. Not like it bothers me. It takes 10 minutes to fix, assuming he’s not breathing down my neck. He should’ve sabotaged the comm network. Now that would’ve been a challenge. But again, coordination.</p>
    <p>Seth acted like it was an omen, that ‘great tragedy will soon befall Persephone’ or some shit. I laughed along, but he insisting that there was more to it – just to tease me, of course. I said it was just a coincidence, but he just kept waving that stupid sandwich in the air and babbling about numbers. What a dork.</p>
    <p>Because they obviously don’t mean anything. Bonnie sneezed like 7 times in a row the other day, but you don’t see me trying to find some secret code or message in it. The ‘message’ was that she was sniffing Genny too much when the peppercorns were nearby.</p>
    <p>I wish <span class="scramble">she’d sniff me like</span> that.</p>
